                <h2>Research Assistant with Jordan Terry</h2>
                <p>I worked as a research assistant to help maintain, update, and develop codebases in Python for reinforcement learning research. I also helped to develop a website for the research group using HTML, CSS, Jekyll, etc.</p>

                <h2>Robotics Research Intern</h2>
                <p>As an intern at Naval Research Laboratory, I helped experiment and explore applications of NVIDIA’s Isaac Gym and Isaac Sim. Additionally, I helped to develop and implement reservoir computing for some of the robotics team’s spiking neural net implementations.</p>

                <h2>AI Lead at Northrop Grumman Innovation Labs</h2>
                <p>In the Northrop Grumman lab, I led a team to create a machine learning computer vision model for the identification of algae content in water. The goal of the project was to identify algae blooms in bodies of water on the east coast in order to mitigate damage from said blooms</p>

                <h2>AI Engineer at Renesas</h2>
                <p>At Renesas, I added features to the company’s proprietary toolkits related to ML model performance and creation. These client-facing features help customers develop better ML model for application on their problems. I also analyzed various performance changes of the codebase after changes.</p>
