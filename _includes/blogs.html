                  <h4>AI Lead at Northrop Grumman Innovation Labs</h4>
                  <p>In the Northrop Grumman lab, I led a team to create a machine learning computer vision model for the identification of algae content in water. The goal of the project was to identify algae blooms in bodies of water on the east coast in order to mitigate damage from said blooms</p>

                  <h4>AI Engineer at Renesas</h4>
                  <p>At Renesas, I added features to the company's proprietary toolkits related to ML model performance and creation. These client-facing features help customers develop better ML model for application on their problems. I also analyzed various performance changes of the codebase after changes.</p>
