            <p class="paragraph-text justify-text">
                I am a highly motivated machine learning engineer and data scientist with experience in research. My current research focuses on federated learning as well as ML on the edge, but I also have a more casual interest in reinforcement learning. I am proficient in python, pytorch, numpy, pandas and other popular data science and ML libraries.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph-text justify-text">
                I’m currently a student at the University of Maryland majoring in computer science and minoring in statistics. Most recently, I worked as an AI engineer at Renesas, a microchip and semi-conductor company.

                Outside of machine learning, I also love to develop games, paint, and cook in my spare time.
